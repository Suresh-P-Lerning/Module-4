                <p>After a historic, unprecedented direct bombing by the US on Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, on June 21, the world awaited Iran's response. On June 23, Iran responded by striking the largest US military base in the Middle East, Al-Udeid, in Qatar, with prior warning given to Qatar to minimise casualties. Satellite images captured by Planet Labs, a San Francisco-based Earth imaging company, further corroborated that the base was nearly empty of aircraft ahead of the attack. While the US used Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker busters and Tomahawk cruise missiles, Iran's reprisal was limited in scope. Trump thanked Iran in a post on Truth Social after the strikes for giving early warning, and hours after, Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The world sitting at the edge of its seat as Iran hit US base, witnessed panic of wider war turn into a path for peace within hours. Iran's limited retaliation echoes their previous response to the US assassination of Maj Gen Qassim Suleimani in 2020. The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a "forceful revenge." But days later, when Iran fired a series of ballistic missiles at US troops in Iraq, it gave Iraq's prime minister at the time, Adel Abdul Mahfi, prior notice of the impending attack.</p>
